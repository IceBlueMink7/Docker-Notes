- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers
- What is Docker Image and Container?
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker Image – single file with all the dependencies and configurations required to run a program
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker Container – Instance of an Image. Runs a program
- Running a command
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triggers the Docker CLI to reach out to the Docker Hub to download an Image with all the configurations required to download a program.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This image is a single file installed onto your computer
- Docker Client (CLI) – Tool we use to issue commands to
- Docker Server (Daemon) – Tool responsible for creating images, running containers, etc
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never really reach out to the docker server, it runs behind the scenes
